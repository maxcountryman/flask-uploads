#: This just contains plain text files (.txt).
TEXT = ("txt",)

#: This contains various office document formats (.rtf, .odf, .ods, .gnumeric,

#: of Microsoft Office 2007 files are not included.
DOCUMENTS = tuple("rtf odf ods gnumeric abw doc docx xls xlsx pdf".split())

#: This contains basic image types that are viewable from most browsers (.jpg,
#: .jpe, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .svg, .bmp and .webp).

#: This contains audio file types (.wav, .mp3, .aac, .ogg, .oga, and .flac).

#: This is for structured data files (.csv, .ini, .json, .plist, .xml, .yaml,
#: and .yml).
DATA = tuple("csv ini json plist xml yaml yml".split())

#: This contains various types of scripts (.js, .php, .pl, .py .rb, and .sh).
#: If your Web server has PHP installed and set to auto-run, you might want to
#: add ``php`` to the DENY setting.
SCRIPTS = tuple("js php pl py rb sh".split())

#: This contains archive and compression formats (.gz, .bz2, .zip, .tar,
#: .tgz, .txz, and .7z).
ARCHIVES = tuple("gz bz2 zip tar tgz txz 7z".split())

#: This contains nonexecutable source files - those which need to be
#: compiled or assembled to binaries to be used. They are generally safe to
#: accept, as without an existing RCE vulnerability, they cannot be compiled,
#: assembled, linked, or executed. Supports C, C++, Ada, Rust, Go (Golang),
#: FORTRAN, D, Java, C Sharp, F Sharp (compiled only), COBOL, Haskell, and
#: assembly.
