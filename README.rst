Flask-Reuploaded
================

Flask-Reuploaded provides file uploads for Flask.


Notes on this package
---------------------

This is an independently maintained version of `Flask-Uploads`
based on the 0.2.1 version of the original,
but also including four years of unreleased changes,
at least not released to PyPi.

Noteworthy is the fix for the `Werkzeug` API change.


Goals
-----

- provide a stable drop-in replacement for `Flask-Uploads`
- regain momentum for this widely used package
- provide working PyPI packages


Migration guide from `Flask-Uploads`
------------------------------------

If you have used `Flask-Uploads` and want to migrate to `Flask-Reuploaded`,
you only have to install `Flask-Reuploaded` instead of `Flask-Uploads`.

That's all!

So, if you use `pip` to install your packages, instead of ...

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install `Flask-Uploads`  # don't do this! package is broken

... just do ...

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install `Flask-Reuploaded`

`Flask-Reuploaded` is a drop-in replacement.

This means you do not have to change a single line of code.


Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install Flask-Reuploaded


Getting started
---------------

create an UploadSet

.. code-block:: python

    from flask_uploads import IMAGES

    photos = UploadSet("photos", IMAGES)

configure your Flask app and this extension

.. code-block:: python

    app.config["UPLOADED_PHOTOS_DEST"] = "static/img"
    app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = os.urandom(24)
    configure_uploads(app, photos)

use `photos` in your view function

.. code-block:: python

    photos.save(request.files['photo'])

See below for a complete example.

Minimal example application
----------------------------


Application code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    import os

    from flask import Flask, flash, render_template, request
    # please note the import from `flask_uploads` - not `flask_reuploaded`!!
    # this is done on purpose to stay compatible with `Flask-Uploads`
    from flask_uploads import IMAGES, UploadSet, configure_uploads

    app = Flask(__name__)
    photos = UploadSet("photos", IMAGES)
    app.config["UPLOADED_PHOTOS_DEST"] = "static/img"
    app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = os.urandom(24)
    configure_uploads(app, photos)


    @app.route("/", methods=['GET', 'POST'])
    def upload():
        if request.method == 'POST' and 'photo' in request.files:
            photos.save(request.files['photo'])
            flash("Photo saved successfully.")
            return render_template('upload.html')
        return render_template('upload.html')


HTML code for `upload.html`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: html

    <!doctype html>
    <html lang=en>
    <head>
        <meta charset=utf-8>
        <title>Flask-Reuploaded Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        {% with messages = get_flashed_messages() %}
        {% if messages %}
        <ul class=flashes>
        {% for message in messages %}
            <li>{{ message }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
        </ul>
        {% endif %}
    {% endwith %}

    <form method=POST enctype=multipart/form-data action="{{ url_for('upload') }}">
        <input type=file name=photo>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
